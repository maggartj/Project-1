# This file contains information about the schema for the Employment Reimbursement system.
# You should first create a database, which you can do using the DB manager of your choice.
# The schema consists of three simple tables. Once the tables are set up, you will need to
# add a manager to the employee table. My recommendation for setup is as follows:
CREATE DATABASE newdb

CREATE TABLE employee ( username varchar(10), upassword varchar(15), ismanager boolean );
CREATE TABLE requests ( username varchar(10), newRequest char(7), amount decimal(5,2), pending boolean, approved boolean, timestamp timestamp default current_timestamp );
CREATE TABLE history ( username varchar(10), request char(7), amount decimal(5,2), timestamp timestamp default current_timestamp );

# Currently, there are no checks for referential integrity because it is unnecessary in this simple implementation of the system
